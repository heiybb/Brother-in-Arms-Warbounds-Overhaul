# Brother-in-Arms-Warbounds-Overhaul
This MOD adds appropriate description into the Skill Tag Item, extremely helpful for people playing with other language or not super familiar with vanilla skills.

All descriptions all fetch from the vanilla skills file using scripts.(Please excuse if there is anything wrong)  

**Man branch's `skill tag` has no class requirement.If you dont like it, you can choose the [skill-tag-class-req](https://github.com/heiybb/Brother-in-Arms-Warbounds-Overhaul/tree/skill-tag-class-req) branch to build**

The weapon requirements are still in English.
You can always translate it yourself.
